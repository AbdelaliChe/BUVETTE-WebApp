The ENSAH Buvette Management WebApp is a project aimed at providing a user-friendly and efficient web-based platform for managing orders and products at the ENSAH buvette. 

## Features

- An application web for managing the buvette and specifically the clients' orders, with authentication for admins and users.
- Admins can manage categories and products (add, modify, delete) and modify the status of orders.
- Categories are identified by an id, name, and image, and can contain one or multiple products.
- Products are identified by an id, name, image, price, and id-category (a foreign key referencing id category).
- Users are identified by an id, name, prenom, email, and password and can register and place orders.
- Orders have a product name, price, quantity, total price, client name, table number, and status (delivered, pending, or canceled). The status can be modified by admins.
- The goal is to solve the problem of delays in taking orders and provide an efficient solution for managing the buvette for both admins and users.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the front-end
- PHP for the back-end
- MySQL for the database management
